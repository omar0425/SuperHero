## Documentation

Under the Add Your Own Super Hero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è heading, you can add another super hero and display it to the page. The Super Hero is added to our db.json server, so you never have to worry about losing your Super Hero data again. Data that you are able to include to the Super Hero Page servers include Super Hero name, Image url,
First Appearence, and Publisher. Click the add SuperHero button and your on your way to adding a super hero of your choice to the collection.
